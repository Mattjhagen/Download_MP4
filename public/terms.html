      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>This service converts video URLs to MP3 audio. You must use it only for content that you own or for which you have explicit permission to download and convert. Do not use this tool to copy or distribute copyrighted material without authorization.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Copyright and Platform Rules</h2>
      <p>Downloading or converting videos from platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, or others is often restricted by their Terms of Service and by copyright law. Converting YouTube videos to MP3, for example, typically creates unauthorized copies and may violate YouTube’s terms. You are responsible for ensuring your use complies with applicable platform rules and copyright law.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Fair Use</h2>
      <p>In some jurisdictions, limited use of copyrighted material may be permitted under “fair use” or similar doctrines (e.g., for criticism, comment, teaching, or research). You are responsible for determining whether your use qualifies and for obtaining any necessary rights.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>This tool is provided “as is.” We do not guarantee availability, accuracy, or compatibility with all video sources. We are not responsible for how you use the converted files or for any infringement of third-party rights.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Changes</h2>
      <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
